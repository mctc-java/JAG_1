 To upgrade to Windows 10, a computer needs to have:

 •	Either Windows 7 OR Windows 8 installed
 •	1 GHz or faster processor
 •	2 GB or more RAM

 Write a program that asks the user for the current version of their
 operating system, the CPU speed, and amount of RAM.

 Use && and || in conditions to display a message telling the user
 if they are able to install Windows 10.
